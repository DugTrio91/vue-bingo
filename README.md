# Vue Bingo

## How to play
To play bingo with this generator you will need to use your 11 digit UK mobile number.

You drop the first `0` and split the remaining numbers into 5 x 2 digit numbers.

If your number was `07812345678`, your bingo numbers would be `78` `12` `34` `56` and `78`.

If you have repeating numbers like `07912891289`, you add 1 to each subsequent number. I.e. `79` `12` `89` `13` and `90`.

Unlike a normal bingo machine, this one goes from 0 to 99.

If someone calls 'BINGO!', you can verify their numbers have been called by clicking 'verify' in the top left corner.

Some numbers are special and will play a video or sound (from YouTube) in the background.

Have fun!
